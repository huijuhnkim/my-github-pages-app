        fullDescription:
            "EPPA transforms an affordable expression pedal into an intuitive playback controller for Logic Pro, making audio production more accessible for visually impaired musicians and engineers. This project was inspired by Dr. Abir Saha's research paper \"Understanding Audio Production Practices of People with Vision Impairments\", which highlights the accessibility challenges and high costs faced by blind audio professionals.\n" +

            "üéØ Problem\n" +
            "\n" +
            "EPPA addresses two critical challenges identified in accessibility research:\n" +
            "\n" +
            "- Cost Barrier: Professional accessible control surfaces can cost upwards of $10,000\n" +
            "- Complexity: Existing assistive technologies have steep learning curves that create additional barriers\n" +
            "\n" +
            "üí° Solution\n" +
            "\n" +
            "EPPA uses a simple, intuitive control scheme inspired by driving:\n" +
            "\n" +
            "- 80-100% (Gas): Full playback\n" +
            "- 20-80% (Coasting): Solo current track\n" +
            "- 0-20% (Brake): Stop playback\n" +
            "\n" +
            "‚Åá Why Expression Pedals?\n" +
            "\n" +
            "- Affordable: Quality pedals start at $30 (vs $10,000+ for control surfaces)\n" +
            "- Intuitive: Single-axis control mimics familiar gas pedal interaction\n" +
            "- Accessible: Hands-free operation leaves hands available for instruments or keyboard navigation\n" +
            "- Universal: Works with any standard expression pedal\n" +
            "\n" +
            "üöÄ Features\n" +
            "\n" +
            "- Real-time MIDI device selection\n" +
            "- Visual pedal position indicator with accessibility labels\n" +
            "- Native Logic Pro integration via keyboard shortcuts\n" +
            "- Automatic solo state management",
